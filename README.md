# Blogaml

This is a prototype to write blog posts with executable OCaml code blocks.

It was made for [this blog post](https://choum.net/panglesd/undo-monad/) (the executable code blocks are in [this section](https://choum.net/panglesd/undo-monad/#the-ocaml-implementation)).

It is usable (see [bin/index.html](https://github.com/panglesd/blogaml/blob/main/bin/index.html) for an (uncleaned) example) but lacks:
- Proper styling, and coolness,
- Merlin support,
- The possibility to use other libraries.
